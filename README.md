# My dotfiles
This repository contains my Linux configurations with scripts to automatically load the configs into the system.

## How to use it
All the available commands are accessible from the `dotfiles` executable file at the repository root. Some of them need root privileges, but these commands will tell you if you need it.

To get the commands list, please call `dotfiles` without any arguments. Please, **don't directly call the script**.
